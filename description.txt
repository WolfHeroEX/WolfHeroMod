Currently only two pickaxes and a costume accessory. A personal mod made to practice with.

Bugs:
White pixel on jump sprite.
Neff costume vanishes when using auto-pause in inventory or menu.

Future changes:
Fix up recipe balancing based on tiers.
Fix up item balancing based on tiers.
Add more items, including more tiers of existing mod items.

Throw me some suggestions for new features and solutions to the bugs at the github!~ I'm very new to this, so please don't suggest anything extravagant without an explination on how to accomplish it. Thanks!
